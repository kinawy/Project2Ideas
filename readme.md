Fork & Clone this repo.

## Part 1

Review the [Project 2 requirements](https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/sei-ga-sea/11-projects/project-2#project-feedback-evaluation) and check out some [examples](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tmdarneille.gitbook.io/sei-ga-sea/11-projects/past-projects/project2&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1597596784944000&usg=AOvVaw1ihTzKFunxKsL2f6sIYdlC).

In this space below, list **THREE** ideas for your Project 2. For each idea, include [user stories](https://revelry.co/user-stories-that-dont-suck/) for each idea and a link to the API(s) you want to use for it.

--------------------------------------------------------
1. An automatic email sender for when my roommate gets a new linkedin connection or has to send mass emails to people on his contact list.
[Nodemailer Site](https://nodemailer.com/about/)
[Nodemailer Plugins](https://nodemailer.com/plugins/)
This could possibly use the nodemailer plugin and the nodemailer plugin.
My roommate would be able to scrape the email and automatically send an email to a provided email through their Linkedin, if an email is provided.
My roommate would potentially be able to send mass emails to people on his contact list using a simple script as well, might work on that on the side.
2. A slideshow remote.
[Google Slides API](https://developers.google.com/slides)
[MDN Presentation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Presentation_API)
A user would be able to remotely control a slideshow from their phone to their computer.
A user would swipe left or right to go through the slides.
A user would possibly be able to move up and down on a page, maybe even control their whole window with it through their phone.
3. An app where you list no longer used computer parts that you're willing to give away for free.  
A user would be able to list parts for view by potential new owners.
A user would be able to facilitate mailing of parts through the website, perhaps through UPS or FEDEX pickup, maybe even USPS if they don't kill the postal service. :(
A user would be able to browse parts and select as needed, maybe listing what they already have for parts to check for compatibility.
[FedEx API](https://www.fedex.com/en-ca/resources-tools/api.html)
[MapBox API](https://www.mapbox.com/)
